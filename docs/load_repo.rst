Loading a Repository
====================

To use Elegit with your project, you will first need to have an existing Git repository, either locally on your computer or remotely on a site such as Github. If you do not have a local copy of your project, click ``Clone repository``. Otherwise, click ``Load existing repository`` and navigate to the folder containing the repository.

A repository has succesfully loaded when its :ref:`tree view <tree-view>` is shown.
