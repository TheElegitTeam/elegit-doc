Notes About Documentation
==============================

Who are we writing documentation for?

* Users â€“ generally students

Good things to have
-------------------
Here are some good things that quality documentation might have:

* A description of what exactly the project is (for people who google it, ect.)
* Example of what it would be used for 
* FAQs (that are kept up to date!)
* Information for people who want to contribute
* Installation instructions
* The project's license

There are three main formats for the different types of documentation (from https://jacobian.org/writing/what-to-write/)

1. step-by-step tutorials (quick, easy, not too easy, sense of project)
2. overviews and topical guids to the various conceptual areas of the project (majority of the documentation)
3. low-level, deep-dive reference material (details for more advanced users)
