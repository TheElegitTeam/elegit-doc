Help Add Documentation
======================

Elegit is an educational tool. If there is something unclear that you would like to explain better, create documentation for it!

The documentation for Elegit is written in `reStructuredText <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_ and generated using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5.1/>`_. You can add documentation files to our `documentation repository <https://github.com/TheElegitTeam/elegit-doc>`_.
