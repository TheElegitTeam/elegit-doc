Working Tree
------------
The **Working Tree** is the directory of files that you are currently changing on the branch you are on. For more information about branches and branching, see :ref:`branch`. The **Working Tree** pane in Elegit is your main way of seeing what files you have created, changed, or deleted. Clicking the **All Files** tab allows you to browse the file structure of your repository. Files in the working tree are tagged to represent their status.
